# Inter-Area OSPF Network Setup

## Overview
In this lab, we are setting up an inter-area OSPF network using 8 Cisco 2911 routers in Packet Tracer. One of the routers will simulate an ISP, where other routers will aim to reach the each other as well as the "internet," represented by the IP address 8.8.8.8. This project will guide you through configuring OSPF across multiple areas, summarizing routes, and establishing default routes to reach the internet.

## Network Design
The network topology consists of:

-ISP Router: Simulates the internet and is connected to the ASBR via a static route.
-ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router): Connects the OSPF domain to the ISP and is also linked to two Area Border Routers (ABRs).
-ABR1 and ABR2: These routers are part of the OSPF backbone area (Area 0) and are responsible for connecting other areas.
-Area 51: Consists of R1 and R2, connected through ABR1.
-Area 29: Consists of R3 and R4, connected through ABR2.
-Loopback Interfaces: Each of the routers R1-R4 has four loopback interfaces representing different networks.
-The goal is to configure OSPF to connect all routers, summarize their routes via the ASBR, and enable default routing for internet connectivity.
