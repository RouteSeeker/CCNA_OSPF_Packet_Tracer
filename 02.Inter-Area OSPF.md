# Inter-Area OSPF Network Setup

## Overview
In this lab, we are setting up an inter-area OSPF network using 8 Cisco 2911 routers in Packet Tracer. One of the routers will simulate an ISP, where other routers will aim to reach the each other as well as the "internet," represented by the IP address 8.8.8.8. This project will guide you through configuring OSPF across multiple areas, summarizing routes, and establishing default routes to reach the internet.

## Network Design
The network topology consists of:

- ISP Router: Simulates the internet and is connected to the ASBR via a static route.
- ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router): Connects the OSPF domain to the ISP and is also linked to two Area Border Routers (ABRs).
- ABR1 and ABR2: These routers are part of the OSPF backbone area (Area 0) and are responsible for connecting other areas.
- Area 51: Consists of R1 and R2, connected through ABR1.
- Area 29: Consists of R3 and R4, connected through ABR2.
- Loopback Interfaces: Each of the routers R1-R4 has four loopback interfaces representing different networks.
- The goal is to configure OSPF to connect all routers, summarize their routes via the ASBR, and enable default routing for internet connectivity.

## Step 1: Initial Router Setup

To begin, I configured the basic settings on all routers. This included assigning IP addresses to each router interface and ensuring that each router had a unique hostname. I also made sure all routers were connected according to the topology plan.

### ISP

```
hostname ISP
int g0/0 
ip address 203.114.25.1 255.255.255.252

```
## Step 2: Configuring OSPF on Routers

Next, I enabled OSPF on all routers except for the ISP router and assigned each interface to its designated OSPF area. R1 and R2 were placed in Area 51, while R3 and R4 were assigned to Area 29. ABR1, ABR2, and ASBR were configured to remain in Area 0. On the ASBR, I set up route redistribution between OSPF and the ISPâ€™s static routes. Additionally, the ASBR was configured to advertise a default route to all OSPF areas.

### ASBR
```
router ospf 1
router-id 1.1.1.1
network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 10.0.10.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
default-information originate
```

### ABR1
```
router ospf 1
router-id 2.2.2.2
network 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 51
network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 51
exit
```
### ABR2
```
router ospf 1
router-id 3.3.3.3
network 10.0.10.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 29
network 172.16.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 29
exit
```

### R1
```
router ospf 1
router-id 4.4.4.4
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 51
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
network 192.168.11.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
network 192.168.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
network 192.168.13.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
exit
```

### R2
```
router ospf 1
router-id 5.5.5.5
network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 51
network 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
network 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
network 192.168.5.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
network 192.168.6.0 0.0.0.255 area 51
exit
```

### R3
```
router ospf 1
router-id 6.6.6.6
network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 29
network 172.16.3.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
network 172.16.4.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
network 172.16.5.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
network 172.16.6.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
exit
```
### R4
```
router ospf 1
router-id 7.7.7.7
network 172.16.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 29
network 172.16.7.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
network 172.16.8.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
network 172.16.9.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
network 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 29
exit
```

The next step is to confirm that OSPF neighbors have successfully formed and that OSPF routes have been correctly learned by each router.

## Step 3: Verification

The next step is to verify that OSPF neighbors have been established successfully and to check the IP routing tables to ensure all OSPF routes have been properly learned.

## Step 4: Set Up Route Summarization on ABRs

The next step was to summarize the networks advertised from each area at the ABRs. This helps reduce the size of the routing tables in other areas and simplifies overall network management.

### ABR1
```
router ospf 1
area 51 range 192.168.0.0 255.255.240.0
```

### ABR2
```
router ospf 1
area 29 range 172.16.0.0 255.255.240.0
```

## Final Thoughts
This setup demonstrates not only the configuration of inter-area OSPF but also highlights the significance of route summarization and default routing. By following these steps, you will create a robust OSPF network that is scalable and adaptable to changes while ensuring consistent and reliable routing. Enjoy building your network and exploring the complexities of OSPF!
