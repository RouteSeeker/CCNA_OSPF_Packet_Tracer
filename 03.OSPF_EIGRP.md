# OSPF EIGRP Network Setup

## Overview

In this lab, I worked with 11 Cisco 2911 routers to simulate a realistic networking environment using OSPF and EIGRP protocols. The goal was to connect the entire network so that all routers, including those in different OSPF areas and EIGRP autonomous systems, could communicate with each other. Additionally, I ensured that the routers could ping the 8.8.8.8 loopback IP address, simulating an external connection to an ISP.

## Network Design

The network topology consists of:

- ISP (8.8.8.8) ↔ ASBR (125.100.1.0/30) (Area 0)
- ASBR ↔ ABR1 (192.168.1.0/30) ↔ R1 (Area 10, 100.0.1.0/30) (Loopbacks: 100.1.x.0/24)
- ASBR ↔ ABR2 (192.168.2.0/30) ↔ R2 (Area 20, 30.0.1.0/30)
- ASBR ↔ ABR3 (192.168.3.0/30) ↔ R2 (Area 20, 30.0.2.0/30)
- R2 ↔ ABR5 (30.0.3.0/30) ↔ R4 (EIGRP 100, 70.1.1.0/30) (Loopbacks: 70.1.x.0/24)
- ASBR ↔ ABR4 (192.168.4.0/30) ↔ R3 (EIGRP 200, 10.1.0.0/30) (Loopbacks: 10.1.x.0/24)

### Step 1: Initial Configuration of the ISP Router
#### 1.ISP Simulation

The ISP router represented an external connection, and I assigned a loopback address of 8.8.8.8 to simulate a public IP that all other routers should be able to reach. This provided a clear destination to test connectivity across the network.

```
hostname ISP
int loopback1
ip address 8.8.8.8 255.255.255.255
```
#### 2. Configured Static Routing to ASBR
Since this router was outside the OSPF and EIGRP network, I used a static route to communicate with the ASBR.

```
int s0/0/0
ip address 125.100.1.1 255.255.255.252
no shut
ip route 125.100.1.0 255.255.255.252 Serial0/0/0
```
### Step 2: Configuring the ASBR Router
The ASBR (Autonomous System Border Router) acted as a bridge between OSPF and EIGRP. I connected it to the ISP and the other routers in OSPF Area 0, setting up the backbone of the network.

#### 1.Configured Interfaces
The ASBR had multiple interfaces connecting to different routers in Area 0.
```

```

#### 2. Configured OSPF on the ASBR
Since the ASBR was part of multiple OSPF areas, I enabled OSPF and added the network statements for Area 0.
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
default-information originate

int s0/0/1
ip ospf network point-to-point
```
### Step 3: Configuring ABR Routers
The ABRs (Area Border Routers) were responsible for connecting OSPF areas to one another. In this lab, I had four ABRs, each connecting to the ASBR in Area 0.

#### 1.Configured OSPF on ABR Routers
ABR1
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 100.0.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 10
int s0/0/0
ip ospf network point-to-point
```
ABR2
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 30.0.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 20
```
ABR3
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 30.0.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 20
```
ABR4
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
```
ABR5
```
router ospf 1
network 30.0.3.0 0.0.0.3 area 20
```
### Step 4: Configuring EIGRP on R1,R3,ABR4 and ABR5
R1
```
router ospf 1
network 100.0.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 10
network 100.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
network 100.1.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
network 100.1.3.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
network 100.1.4.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
```
#### EIGRP 200
ABR4
```
router eigrp 200
network 10.1.0.0 0.0.0.3
```

R3
router eigrp 200
network 10.1.0.0 0.0.0.3
network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
network 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255
network 10.1.3.0 0.0.0.255
network 10.1.4.0 0.0.0.255

#### EIGRP 100
ABR5
```
router eigrp 100
network 70.1.1.0 0.0.0.3
```
R4
```
router eigrp 00
network 70.1.1.0 0.0.0.3
network 70.1.2.0 0.0.0.255
network 70.1.3.0 0.0.0.255
network 70.1.4.0 0.0.0.255
network 70.1.5.0 0.0.0.255
```
### Step 5: Configuring Route Redistribution
Since both OSPF and EIGRP were running in different parts of the network, I set up route redistribution to ensure routes from one protocol were visible in the other. This allowed routes from EIGRP to be known in OSPF and vice versa.

ABR1
```
router ospf 1
area 10 range 100.1.0.0 255.255.248.0
```
ABR5
```
router ospf 1
redistribute eigrp 100 subnets
exit
router eigrp 100
redistribute ospf 1 metric 10000 100 255 1 1500
auto-summary
```
ABR4
```
router ospf 1
redistribute eigrp 200 subnets
exit
router eigrp 200
redistribute ospf 1 metric 10000 100 255 1 1500
auto-summary
```
### Step 6: Testing and Troubleshooting
After configuring the routers, I tested connectivity to ensure everything was working as expected.

#### 1.Pinged the ISP from R4
I ensured that R4 could reach the 8.8.8.8 loopback on the ISP router.

![ISP Ping}(https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_OSPF_Packet_Tracer/blob/main/assets/screenshots/OSPF_EIGRP/03.Ping_ISP.PNG)

#### 2.Checked the Routing Tables
On each router, I checked the routing table to verify that routes from the other protocols were being learned.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, I successfully connected routers using OSPF and EIGRP across multiple areas and autonomous systems. Through route redistribution, I ensured that all routers could communicate with each other, including reaching external networks like the simulated ISP. This lab demonstrated the importance of route redistribution in real-world scenarios, where multiple protocols often coexist and require seamless communication.
