# Connecting BGP and OSPF Networks
In this lab, I worked with 10 Cisco 2911 routers using a combination of BGP and OSPF to simulate real-world networking scenarios. The goal was to ensure seamless communication between all routers, including enabling the end routers to ping each other effortlessly, despite being in different OSPF areas and connected via different BGP autonomous systems.

## Network Overview
ASBR1 and ASBR2 were connected using BGP on the network 102.50.36.0/30.

ASBR1 used BGP Autonomous System 100.

ASBR2 used BGP Autonomous System 200.

ASBR2 connected to:
- ABR3 on 20.1.3.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
- ABR4 on 20.1.4.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
  
ABR3 connected to R3 on 192.168.30.0/24 in OSPF Area 30.

ABR4 connected to R4 on 192.168.40.0/24 in OSPF Area 40.

ASBR1 connected to:
- ABR1 on 10.1.1.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
- ABR2 on 10.1.2.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
  
ABR1 connected to R1 on 192.168.10.0/24 in OSPF Area 10.

ABR2 connected to R2 on 192.168.20.0/24 in OSPF Area 20.
