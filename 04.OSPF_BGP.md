# Connecting BGP and OSPF Networks
In this lab, I worked with 10 Cisco 2911 routers using a combination of BGP and OSPF to simulate real-world networking scenarios. The goal was to ensure seamless communication between all routers, including enabling the end routers to ping each other effortlessly, despite being in different OSPF areas and connected via different BGP autonomous systems.

## Network Overview
ASBR1 and ASBR2 were connected using BGP on the network 102.50.36.0/30.

ASBR1 used BGP Autonomous System 100.

ASBR2 used BGP Autonomous System 200.

ASBR2 connected to:
- ABR3 on 20.1.3.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
- ABR4 on 20.1.4.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
  
ABR3 connected to R3 on 192.168.30.0/24 in OSPF Area 30.

ABR4 connected to R4 on 192.168.40.0/24 in OSPF Area 40.

ASBR1 connected to:
- ABR1 on 10.1.1.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
- ABR2 on 10.1.2.0/30 in OSPF Area 0.
  
ABR1 connected to R1 on 192.168.10.0/24 in OSPF Area 10.

ABR2 connected to R2 on 192.168.20.0/24 in OSPF Area 20.

## Step 1: Initial IP configuraton

The first step involved configuring the initial IP settings for all the routers and assigning them appropriate hostnames.

ASBR1
```
hostname ASBR1
int g0/0
ip address 102.50.36.1 255.255.255.252
no shut

int g0/1
ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.252
no shut

int g0/2
ip address 10.1.2.1 255.255.255.252
no shut

int l0
ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
no shut
exit
```

ASBR2
```
hostname ASBR2
int g0/0
ip address 102.50.36.2 255.255.255.252

int l0
ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255
no shut
exit
```

ABR1
```
hostname ABR1
int g0/0
ip address 10.1.1.2 255.255.255.252
no shut

int g0/1
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

exit
```

ABR3
```
hostname ABR3
int g0/0
ip address 20.1.3.2 255.255.255.252
no shut

int g0/1
ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0

int l0
ip address 5.5.5.5 255.255.255.255

exit
```

ABR4
```
hostname ABR4
int g0/0
ip address 20.1.4.2 255.255.255.252
no shut

int g0/1
ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0
no shut

int l0
ip address 6.6.6.6 255.255.255.255
no shut
exit
```

R1
```
hostname R1
int g0/0
ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0
no shut

int l0
ip address 7.7.7.7 255.255.255.255

exit
```

R2
```
hostname R2

exit
```
R3
```
hostname R3
int g0/0
ip address 192.168.30.2 255.255.255.0
no shut

int l0
ip address 9.9.9.9 255.255.255.255
no shut
exit
```
R4
```
hostname R4
int g0/0
ip address 192.168.40.2 255.255.255.0
no shut

int l0
ip address 10.10.10.10 255.255.255.255
no shut
exit
```
## Step 2:OSPF Configuration Across the Network
To connect the routers in different OSPF areas, I configured OSPF on all routers. Each router was configured to advertise its connected networks and establish neighbor relationships with the adjacent routers.

ASBR1
```
router ospf 1
network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
```
ASBR2
```
router ospf 1
network 20.1.3.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 20.1.4.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
```
ABR1
```
router ospf 1
network 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 3.3.3.3 0.0.0.0 area 0
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
```
ABR2
```
router ospf 1
network 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 4.4.4.4 0.0.0.0 area 0
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 20
```
ABR3
```
router ospf 1
network 20.1.3.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 5.5.5.5 0.0.0.0 area 0
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 30
```
ABR4
```
router ospf 1
network 20.1.4.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
network 6.6.6.6 0.0.0.0 area 0
network 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 area 40
```
R1
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 10
network 7.7.7.7 0.0.0.0 area 10
```
R2
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 20
network 8.8.8.8 0.0.0.0 area 20
```
R3
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 30
network 9.9.9.9 0.0.0.0 area 30
```
R4
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255 area 40
network 10.10.10.10 0.0.0.0 area 40
```
## Step 3: BGP Configuration on ASBR1 and ASBR2
The next step was to configure BGP on the two ASBR routers, assigning BGP 100 to ASBR1 and BGP 200 to ASBR2. Following that, the networks connected to each ASBR were properly configured for BGP advertisement.

ASBR1
```
router bgp 100
neighbor 102.50.36.2 remote-as 200
network 10.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.252
network 10.1.2.0 mask 255.255.255.252
exit
```
ASBR2
```
router bgp 200
neighbor 102.50.36.1 remote-as 100
network 20.1.3.0 mask 255.255.255.252
network 20.1.4.0 mask 255.255.255.252
exit
```
