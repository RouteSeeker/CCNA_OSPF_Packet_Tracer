# BGP, OSPF, GRE, and IPSEC Lab

## Introduction
It has been a while since my last lab, but I'm nearing the completion of my OSPF series. As I prepare for my CCNP, I'm exploring additional services, which led me to create this lab that integrates BGP, OSPF, GRE, and IPSEC. In this setup, I'm using three Cisco 2911 routers: ISP, R1, and R2. The goal is to establish BGP communication between the ISP and the internal routers, create a GRE tunnel over IPSEC, and then share OSPF routes through the tunnel.

## Lab Setup Overview
Routers: 3 Cisco 2911 Routers (ISP, R1, R2)
BGP Configurations:
ISP: BGP 100
R1: BGP 300
R2: BGP 200
GRE Tunnel over IPSEC: Tunnel interface between R1 and R2 using IPSEC for secure data transmission.
Loopback Addresses:
ISP: 3.3.3.3/32
R1: 1.1.1.1/32
R2: 2.2.2.2/32
Network Connections:
R1 to ISP on network 203.21.14.0/30
R2 to ISP on network 100.32.45.0/30
Internal Networks:
R1: 192.168.1.0/24
R2: 192.168.2.0/24
Tunnel IP: 172.16.1.0/30

### Step 1: Initial IP configuraton

The first step involved configuring the initial IP settings for all the routers and assigning them appropriate hostnames.
ISP
```
hostname ISP
int g0/1
ip address 203.21.14.1 255.255.255.252
no shut
int g0/2
ip address 100.32.45.1 255.255.255.252
no shut
int l0
ip address 3.3.3.3 255.255.255.255
```
R1
```
hostname R1
int g0/0
ip address 203.21.14.2 255.255.255.252
no shut
int l0
ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
int l1
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
```
R2
```
hostname R2
int g0/0
ip address 100.32.45.2 255.255.255.252
no shut
int l0
ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.255
int l1
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
```

### Step 2: Configuring BGP on ISP, R1, and R2
To handle routing between my internal network (R1 and R2) and the ISP, I configured BGP. This allows us to easily advertise routes across different autonomous systems.
ISP
```
router bgp 100
neighbor 203.21.14.2 remote-as 300
neighbor 100.32.45.2 remote-as 200
exit
```
R1
```
router bgp 300
neighbor 203.21.14.1 remote-as 100
exit
```
R2
```
router bgp 200
neighbor 100.32.45.1 remote-as 100
exit
```
### Step 3: GRE Tunnel Configuration
To allow OSPF traffic between R1 and R2, I set up a GRE tunnel. Running it over IPSEC helps ensure data security while allowing dynamic routing updates via OSPF.
R1
```
int tunnel1
ip address 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.252
tunnel source g0/0
tunnel destination 100.32.45.2
```
R2
```
int tunnel1
ip address 172.16.1.2 255.255.255.252
tunnel source g0/0
tunnel destination 203.21.14.2
```
### Step 4: OSPF Configuration over GRE Tunnel
With the GRE tunnel in place, I configured OSPF to advertise the internal networks over the tunnel, providing dynamic routing updates between R1 and R2.
R1
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
network 17.16.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
```
R2
```
router ospf 1
network 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 2.2.2.2 0.0.0.0 area 0
network 17.16.1.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
```
### Step 5: Configuring IPSEC for Tunnel Security
To secure traffic over the GRE tunnel between R1 and R2, I used IPSEC. 
Below are the commands I used and why I chose each one.

R1
```
license boot module c2900 technology-package securityk9
exit
reload
```
```
crypto isakmp policy 10
encryption aes
authentication pre-share
group 2
exit
crypto isakmp key IPSECTEST address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
crypto ipsec transform-set RSEEKER esp-aes esp-sha-hmac
ip access-list extended GRE_IN_IPSEC
permit gre any any
exit
crypto map VPN 10 ipsec-isakmp
match address GRE_IN_IPSEC
set transform-set RSEEKER
set peer 100.32.45.2
exit
int g0/0
crypto map VPN
```

R2
```
crypto isakmp policy 10
encryption aes
authentication pre-share
group 2
exit
crypto isakmp key IPSECTEST address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
crypto ipsec transform-set RSEEKER esp-aes esp-sha-hmac
ip access-list extended GRE_IN_IPSEC
permit gre any any
exit
crypto map VPN 10 ipsec-isakmp
match address GRE_IN_IPSEC
set transform-set RSEEKER
set peer 203.21.14.2
exit
int g0/0
crypto map VPN
end
```
#### Explanation of IPSEC Commands:
AES Encryption: I chose AES for strong encryption and efficiency.
Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication: I opted for PSK to simplify the setup and ensure secure authentication.
Transform Set: This defines encryption (esp-aes) and hashing (esp-sha-hmac) for IPSEC, ensuring data integrity.
Access List for GRE Traffic: This access list allows only GRE traffic through the IPSEC tunnel, enhancing security

### Step 6: Verification and Troubleshooting
1. Check BGP Neighbor Status:
```show ip bgp summary```

![BGP Summary](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_OSPF_Packet_Tracer/blob/main/assets/screenshots/OSPF_BGP_GRE_IPSEC/04.BGP_Summary.PNG)

This verifies BGP peer status, confirming communication with the ISP.

2. Verify IPSEC Tunnel Status:
```
show crypto isakmp sa
```
![isakmp sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_OSPF_Packet_Tracer/blob/main/assets/screenshots/OSPF_BGP_GRE_IPSEC/05.ISAKMP_SA.PNG)

```
show crypto ipsec sa
```
![ipsec sa](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_OSPF_Packet_Tracer/blob/main/assets/screenshots/OSPF_BGP_GRE_IPSEC/06.IPSEC_SA.PNG}

These commands confirm the IPSEC tunnel establishment.

3. Test OSPF Reachability:
```
show ip ospf neighbor
```
![OSPF Neighbor](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/CCNA_OSPF_Packet_Tracer/blob/main/assets/screenshots/OSPF_BGP_GRE_IPSEC/06.OSPF_Neighbors.PNG)

Confirms OSPF neighbors are correctly formed over the GRE tunnel.


## Conclusion
This lab brings together BGP, GRE, and IPSEC for a secure, efficient routing setup. BGP connects my internal network to the ISP, GRE encapsulates OSPF traffic across non-OSPF networks, and IPSEC secures the tunnelâ€™s data. This configuration is an ideal practice lab for CCNP studies, touching on secure routing configurations and advanced protocol implementations.
