# CCNA_OSPF_Packet_Tracer
Welcome to the OSPF Labs repository! This project is dedicated to enhancing our understanding of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) through a series of progressively complex labs.

## Overview
This repository will include a variety of lab exercises focusing on OSPF, starting from fundamental configurations to more advanced setups. Here’s what to expect:

Single-Area OSPF: We begin with a simple lab covering the basics of OSPF in a single area, ideal for those new to the protocol.

Multi-Area OSPF: Next, we'll expand into multi-area OSPF to explore how OSPF handles more complex networks and improves scalability.

OSPF with Other IGPs: We’ll integrate OSPF with other interior gateway protocols (IGPs) like EIGRP to understand interoperability and best practices.

OSPF and BGP Integration: Finally, we'll create a comprehensive lab that connects different OSPF networks using BGP, showcasing the integration of interior and exterior gateway protocols.

## Join Me!
Whether you're just starting or looking to deepen your OSPF knowledge, this repository is the perfect place to practice and learn. Join me on this journey as we explore and strengthen our understanding of OSPF and related networking concepts.

Feel free to fork the repository, suggest improvements, or share your own experiences. Let's learn together!

Happy labbing!
